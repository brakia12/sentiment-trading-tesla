# ðŸ’¸ Mood & Money: Tesla Sentiment-Aware Trading Strategy

This project explores a fun and simple trading strategy using **fake Tesla news headlines** and **VADER sentiment analysis** to simulate how market mood might affect trading.

---

## ðŸ§  What It Does

- Uses `vaderSentiment` NLP tool to score the mood of Tesla-related headlines
- Simulates buying TSLA when sentiment is positive, selling when it's negative
- Compares this strategy to a basic Buy & Hold
- Visualizes portfolio performance over time

---

## ðŸ“Š Tools Used

- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `yfinance` to download TSLA historical stock data
- `vaderSentiment` for natural language sentiment scoring
- `matplotlib` for visualization

---

## ðŸš€ Results

ðŸ“ˆ The strategy dynamically adjusts based on mood â€” and it performs comparably (or better) than buy-and-hold depending on the mood data. Try using **real headlines** for even better results!
